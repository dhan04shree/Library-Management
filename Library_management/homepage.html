        <p>A library management website with a focus on book information, issue dates, and submission deadlines brings several advantages to both librarians and patrons. By providing a centralized platform for organizing and tracking library resources, it streamlines administrative tasks and reduces the workload for librarians. Users benefit from increased accessibility, as they can easily access the library's database remotely to check book availability and due dates. This accessibility saves time for patrons who no longer need to physically visit the library or inquire in person. </p>
